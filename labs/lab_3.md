## Introduction
---
The systolic array used by Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) accelerates the matrix computation by using the dataflow operation. The systolic array contains multiple processing elements (PEs), each of them is responsible for the multiply–and-accumulate (MAC) operation. It can performs multiple elements in a matrix simultaneously and achieves high computational throughput.

In this lab, we will use Verilog to implement the PE and a small systolic array composed of 4 x 4 PEs. You may refer to different dataflow stationary policy (e.g. weight and output stationary). 

(Hint: The weight stationary is more complicated than output stationary.)
```{note}
1. This lab does not require demonstration, submit your code to E3 only, details are in [Submission](#submission).


2. You will be asked to put your systolic array on FPGA in ***lab 5***, so please make sure that your systolic array is a synthesizable circuit.
```

## Systolic Array Implementation
---
The goals of this lab are to familiarize you with the concepts of dataflows in systolic array architectures. This will get you hand-on experience with dataflow routing and processing elements implementations. In this lab, you only need to construct the TPU module.

#### Prerequisite

- Python3 with numpy library installed
- `iverilog` or `VCS` or `irun`
- `nWave` or `Verdi` or `GTKWave` or anything that can read `.vcd` or `.fsdb`
- Makefile

#### Requirements

You need to perform Matrix multiplication with one of dataflow stationary method with correct functional simulation in 4x4 Processing elements(PEs). That is, this design can perform (M * K) * (K * N) 8-bit integer matrix multiplication.

Your design should be written in the Verilog. There is no limitation in how you program your design.
Your PEs shouldn’t exceed 4x4, where a 2D systolic array architecture is recommended.
An 8-bits input data, 32-bits accumulated data design. Please be careful with the bit-width problem.
(1024 + 256 ∗ 2) KiBytes in total of global buffer size.

#### Getting Started

This lab will require a beginner’s level of verilog.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nycu-caslab/AAML2025-Lab3.git
```

```{note}
The testbench generates waveform to `dump.vcd` or `dump.fsdb` (change the output file in the `TESTBENCH.v`).
After running the simulation each time, you may use your waveform viewer to check it out. 


    nWave (dump.fsdb | dump.vcd)
    or
    gtkwave dump.vcd
```
```{note}
1. The default verilog compiler in the makefile is `iverilog`, and using `vvp` as simulator.
If you have the licence of `VCS` and want faster simulation, you may use the `Makefile_vcs`.
2. The `Makefile_ncverilog` is for reference only, our Cadence licence has been down for a while :(
```

#### Rules

- Your TPU design (`TPU.v`) should be under the top module which provided by TA, it's fine to add various new files in the `RTL` directory.

- you may not modify the `global_buffer.v`.

- At the start of the simulation, testbench will load the global buffer A & B, which assume that CPU or DMA has already prepared the data for TPU in global buffer. When signal `in_valid == 1`, the size of the two matrices will be available for TPU (m, n, k) for ***only one cycle***.
```{note}
For the details of the mapping of matrix into global buffer. Please refer to the ***[Appendix](#appendix)***. There are two types of mapping. The transposed ***Type A*** for `matrix A`, and ***Type B*** for `matrix B and C`.
```
- Testbench will compare your output global buffer with golden, when you finish the calculation, that is `busy == 0`. Then you need to wait for the next `in_valid` for the next test case.

- You should implement your own data loader, process elements(PEs), and controller which schedule the data in global buffer A & B to be calculated in the systolic array.

- You need to set `busy` to high ***immediately*** after `in_valid` fall from high to low.

- Use asynchronous reset active low architecture.

- The execution latency ***per matrix multiplication*** (not the whole execution time) is limited in ***1,500,000*** cycles.

Example of a 10 * 7 matrix

the memory layout of this matrix looks like (note the transpose in the layout)

### Memory Mapping - Type B (without transpose)

The matrix B looks more forward in memory layout, for example, a 7 * 9 matrix

looks like this in global buffer B, with 0-padded also
